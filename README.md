Some of my data science projects:

* [R] <a href="severe_weather.Rmd">Severe weather</a>: Storms and other severe weather events can cause both public health and economic problems for communities and municipalities. This analysis uses the U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's (NOAA) storm database, which tracks characteristics of major storms and weather events in the United States and its harmful effects, if any.

* [R] <a href="car_transmission_analysis.Rmd">Car transmission analysis</a>: There is a difference between automatic or manual transmission for the fuel economy, measured in miles per gallon (mpg)?

* [Python] <a href="holiday_weather.ipynb">Holiday weather:</a> This project is about finding a fortnight to take a holiday in Barcelona, where I come from, looking for the sunniest and driest two weeks over the last year 2014.
